## Please check the following:
- [ ] **Branching:** I branched out of `develop` and I am targeting `develop` for this PR. (Code directed to `main` will be closed).
- [ ] **AI Code:** If I used AI, I have cleaned up the code, removed bloat, and verified logic.
- [ ] **Translations:** I have used translation keys. I have not included any hardcoded strings (see `howto/TRANSLATIONS.md`).
- [ ] **Components:** I used pre-existing components from `app/_components/GlobalComponents/` or `FeatureComponents/` instead of creating duplicates.
- [ ] **Styling:** I have kept styling consistent and avoided inline styles.
- [ ] **Self-Review:** I have performed a self-review of my code.
